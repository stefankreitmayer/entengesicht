Make up silly words in German! (Because why not)

## Usage

The app starts by giving you two random words. You choose which one to keep. The other one gets modified. And so on ...until you get really bored.

## Requirements

You need a browser that [supports Speech Synthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis#Browser_compatibility).

## Build instructions

* Install [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) version 0.18
* Run `build.sh`
* Open `index.html` in a browser

## What's the point of this?

Just me staying up late, practicing Elm.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the words are generated using a simple random algorithm. There is no guarantee that the results will be funny, grammatically correct or suitable for any audience. Please use this software responsibly and at your own risk.
